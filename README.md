Hello! My name is Ani Tatikonda, a recent Summa Cum Laude graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Go Jackets!) I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Industrial & Systems Engineering with a concentration in Analytics & Data Science, as well as a minor in Microeconomics of Strategic Analysis. I have made data-driven insights that have transformed jet boarding processes nationwide while working at United Airlines, and I have also led a large consultant team to digitally transform an airline while working at CapTech Ventures. My hobbies include fencing, escape rooms, gaming, 100% Steam games, and traveling - I can proudly say that as of June 2025, I have seen the top of the world (Mount Everest)! Please reach out to me at business@ani-tatikonda.com for any inquiries.
